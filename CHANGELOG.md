## Unreleased

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-19
### Added
- Added the `distance_resample` function (and its mutating version `distance_resample!`) for resampling the polygons in a `GeoBorders` instance so that the segments of each ring of the GeoBorder's `polyareas` are not longer than a given distance `target_dist`.
  - Useful for _oversampling_ a GeoBorders to increase the point density along its borders.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-07-11

### Fixed
- Reworked `to_xxx_point` functions to really only rely on `to_raw_lonlat` instead of also on `valuetype` in some cases.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-07-12
### Added
Added a method for `Meshes.paramdim` for `FastInGeometry` objects. This is mostly for supporting calls to `GeoTable` with a domain made of `FastInGeometry`s
